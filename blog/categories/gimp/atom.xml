    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&lsquo;Tito&rsquo; is like Quicksilver inside GIMP. You bring up tito and enter something, it gives a dropdown of possible actions. You hit enter to execute that action. <a href="https://plus.google.com/116053365635940402074">Michael Natterer</a> (maintainer) told me on IRC about a year ago that it can go upstream with a few changes. Quite sadly, I haven&rsquo;t had the time to make those changes.</p>

<p>It works pretty well though. Here are a few screenshots:</p>

<h3>Currently implemented features</h3>

<ul>
<li> It searches first through labels and then tooltips of actions</li>
<li> It supports fuzzy search</li>
<li> It is adaptive: frequently used actions appear higher in the results list</li>
<li> It shows the tooltip, icon and shortcut in each search result if present</li>
<li> It is highly configurable via a preferences window</li>
</ul>

There is also an old <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0PuH1LFWhA">screencast</a> I made. It isn&rsquo;t great, but you can see it in action ;)</p>

<h3>The story behind it</h3>

<p>We were four developers who knew little about gtk and git. We started off well and shared our initial prototype. We got a mix of positive and dismissive responses from the gimp dev list. You can see the <a href="http://www.gimpusers.com/forums/gimp-developer/14142-an-update-on-the-menu-search">thread</a> where the devs and I debated the values it provided.</p>

<p>Quite a few devs tried it out and gave me feedback. I incorporated that feedback and fixed bugs and regularly interacted with the team on how it could be better. But tito got a fair amount of push back from the interaction design perspective.</p>

<h3>We can finish this together</h3>

<p>I really need some company in finishing this up. Mitch (Michael Natterer on IRC) took a look at the diff and suggested a few changes that would make it eligible to go upstream. I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://github.com/ssrihari/gimp-tito/issues">issues</a> for these on github. My gut feeling is that this should take lesser than a week. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/sriharisriraman">get in touch</a> if you are interested. Let&rsquo;s collaborate!</p>
